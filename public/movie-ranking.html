<h1>The Best Movies According to Onomono</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Wall-e</h3>
<p>
  A beautiful movie about how a future where there's no life in the planet and
  hummans live in aircrafts just sitting and eating. Meanwhile, Wall-e, a trash
  robot who lives on Earth, finds a proof of life and meet Eva whom he fall in
  love. It's about friendship, love and make reflect on how we're treating our
  planet.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite movies from Hayao Miyazaki. It's an allegory about the
  horrors of capitalism and society's toxic obsession with work. It's also about
  bravery, love and friendship.
</p>
<h3>Lion King</h3>
<p>
  This is a classic. Lion prince Simba and his father are targeted by his bitter
  uncle Scar, who wants to ascend the throne himself. It's about love, loss,
  facing our fears, forgiveness, friendship and growing.
